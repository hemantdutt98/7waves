                                From the time we enter this world, we embark on a journey of exploring our surroundings and trying to make sense of the world. We try to understand people, places, situations, institutions and life in itself. The irony is that most of us try to understand the world outside when we haven't completely understood what lies within us. Discovering yourself and understanding who you are is a liberating and enlightening experience. Here are a few tips that you can try to answer the fascinating question of "Who am I?":
                                <br>
                                1. Spend Some Time Alone
<br>
2. Challenge Your Limits 
<br>3. Explore Your Interests 
<br>4. Engage in Self-Introspection 
<br>5. Journal as a Form of Self-Expression 
<br> 6. View Yourself from a Holistic Perspective
<br>7. Analyse Changes in Yourself Overtime

                        <p style="padding: 0px 0px 3% 0px;font-size: 23px;color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif,';">
                          While being in other people's company, our decisions and actions get influenced by other people's opinions. Spending time alone will enable you to better understand yourself without being influenced by other people's presence and opinions. The best possible way to do this is: 
                        <br>
                        <u><b>A. To travel alone:</b></u> Travelling is a direct pathway to exploration and discovery. Even a short trip to your nearby localities aloneâ€“ be it your nearby markets, parks, or food joints can also allow you to explore your individual interests and likings.
                          <br>
                          <u><b>B. Try new activities alone: </b></u>You can also engage in solo- activities like cooking, shopping, visiting a museum, riding a bicycle, painting or anything else you like. The key is to perform these activities alone and connect with your inner self. 

                        </p>
                        <H3 style=" font-style: underline">2. <u>Challenge Your Limits

                          Knowing your true potential is essential to know who you are and what you are capable of achieving. This requires you to open yourself up to challenges and come out of your comfort zone to discover previously unknown parts of yourself. You can do this by taking little measures to test your potential. A few things that would be useful would be to: 
                          <br>
                          A. Get up earlier in the morning
                          <br>
                          B. Try to get more work done in less time
                          <br>
                          C. Face your fears- for, e.g. try activities that you have never tried before 
                          <br>
                          D. You never know; you might discover aspects of your abilities that you never knew you possessed. 
                          <br>
                        </p>
                   
                      

                            <H3 style=" font-style: underline">3. <u>Explore Your Interests 
                            </u>

                              Focus on exploring the things or activities that you really enjoy doing or eagerly wish to try. It doesn't matter whether your interests match up to what people consider to be "cool". This is all about you and your self-discovery journey, so follow your heart and note all the things that fascinate you. It can be anything- music, dance, studying about the ocean, collecting coins or leaves; movies; baking; knitting; or even chirping along with birds- be as creative and open as you can.  </p>

                              This is the most crucial step in discovering yourself. All your efforts at solving the mystery called "Me" would be futile if you don't engage in the process of self-introspection. Think profoundly and mindfully about what kind of a person you think you are and what makes you unique. Understand yourself as though you are trying to understand another person. You can initiate this process by asking and answering these questions by following your intuition. 
                            <br>
                            A. What are the qualities that I like about myself?
                              <br>
                              B. What are the aspects that I need to work upon?
                              <br>
                              C. What are the factors that make me unique?
                              <br>
                              D. What are the differences between who I am and want to be?
                              <br>
                              E. Do I do this activity because I enjoy it or because my friends or parents deem it appropriate?

                              Journaling is an excellent strategy that you can employ to express yourself with no filter freely. Journaling provides you with a channel to share things you would feel hesitant to share with others. This would be a cathartic experience and would allow you to let out all your bottled feelings and emotions. This would be your chance to be as raw and real as possible and get to the core of understanding who you are.

                                  Our views of other people are most often positively or negatively biased. The same also applies to our perception of ourselves. We may either be inclined to view ourselves negatively based on our shortcomings or focus on only our positive aspects. The preferable approach is to view yourself holistically along with strengths and weaknesses.

                                  We, humans, are incredibly complex and fascinating beings. Though our personality remains the same, our preferences, tastes, traits, language choices, thought processes etc., change over time. These changes constitute our growth and development, and it is crucial to keep track of them to understand how we have transitioned and grown over time. This would allow you to see yourself in the larger picture and understand how dynamic you are. 

                                </p>

                                  Understanding yourself and discovering who you are is an endeavour that takes its own time and requires patience. Though it is essential to know and understand yourself well, taking your time in doing so is absolutely alright. You don't have to know everything about yourself overnight. Not knowing a part of yourself has its own thrill and mystery. How much of this mystery you wish to solve and how long you want to take is your call. No one can dictate to you on this- since this is all about YOU.
